// Issue #673 part 1: a copy mode snapshot must SHARE the scrollback rows with
// the live grid, copy on write, instead of deep copying the whole history.
//
// Measured on the merged PR #671 tree, one pane at 200 columns with
// `history-limit 60000` filled to `history_size 49953`:
//
//   BEFORE copy mode : working set 197.1 MB  private 191.9 MB
//   IN     copy mode : working set 378.0 MB  private 378.4 MB
//   AFTER  copy mode : working set 199.6 MB  private 192.0 MB
//
// so opening copy mode cost 186.5 MB of private bytes, and repeated enter and
// leave cycles plateaued 61 MB above the baseline. `Parser::snapshot` cloned
// `Screen`, `Screen` cloned `Grid` and `Grid` deep copied every retained row.
//
// A retained row is immutable: `Grid::scroll_up` compacts it once as it becomes
// history (issue #641) and nothing ever writes to it again, which is exactly
// the shape that wants sharing. tmux copies the grid in `window_copy_init`
// (window-copy.c) too, so the snapshot itself is parity; what is not parity is
// paying for the history twice when neither copy can change a single cell of
// it.
//
// These tests pin the sharing by ADDRESS: a retained row must live at the same
// address in the snapshot as in the live grid. They are written so they also
// compile against the pre fix tree, where the rows sit inline in the deque and
// every address differs.
