// Issue #673 part 2: every pane in copy mode holds its OWN snapshot, for as
// long as it is in copy mode.
//
// PR #671 reconciled snapshots with `sync_copy_snapshot`, which gated on the
// active pane of the active window:
//
//     if want && is_active_window && Some(p.id) == active_id { enter } else { leave }
//
// psmux allows several panes in copy mode at once (#607), and `copy-mode -t`
// puts a pane that is not the focused one into copy mode. Such a pane took a
// snapshot while the target focus was borrowed, then lost it on the very next
// frame, so its own output kept pushing the view it was meant to freeze.
// Reproduced against the real server with two panes, both printing, the NON
// active one in copy mode:
//
//   [NON ACTIVE PANE] last visible line before: 'P LINE 93'  after 4s: 'P LINE 152'
//   [ACTIVE PANE]     last visible line before: 'P LINE 32'  after 4s: 'P LINE 32'
//
// tmux has no such gate: `window_copy_init` copies the grid of whichever pane
// enters the mode, and the mode lives on that `window_pane` until it is
// dismissed, focused or not.
//
// These tests drive `sync_copy_snapshot` over a two pane window and a second
// window, with the copy mode pane never being the focused one.
