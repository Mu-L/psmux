// Issue #692: `select-window -t 0` did nothing, while `-t :0` worked.
//
// The reproduction, three runs on each of four routes:
//
//     psmux -L h new-session -d -s s -x 80 -y 24
//     psmux -L h new-window -t s ; psmux -L h new-window -t s
//     psmux -L h select-window -t s:2
//     psmux -L h select-window -t 0
//         psmux: no server running on session 'h__0'      (rc 1, window 2 -> 2)
//
// and from a binding, the control socket and the `:` prompt the same command
// was silent: the binding was stored, the key arrived, the window did not
// change (2/@3 -> 2/@3, three runs of three on each route).
//
// The cause is one sentence in cli.rs `parse_target`: "A bare string without
// ':' or '.' is always a session name, even if numeric".  So `0` was looked up
// as a SESSION and the window number never reached the window resolver.
//
// tmux resolves a window command's -t through cmd_find_get_window
// (cmd-find.c:328).  It sets `fs->s = fs->current->s`, the CURRENT session,
// and calls cmd_find_get_window_with_session first (:344); that tries an @id
// (:382), then the offsets and symbols from cmd_find_window_table (:389,
// :418), then "First see if this is a valid window index in this session"
// (:443, `strtonum` + `winlink_find_by_index`), then a window NAME.  Only when
// all of that fails does it try the token as a session itself (:348).  The
// index wins over a session of the same name.
//
// The second half of the report, `select-window -t @1` not switching while
// `@2` and `@3` did, did NOT reproduce: a 16 case matrix (2 and 4 window
// fixtures, parking on each window in turn, selecting every id) came back OK
// on all 16, three runs, on the CLI, the socket, a binding and the prompt.
// Window ids start at @1, so in the fixture that produced the report `@1` was
// the window already active and "did not switch" is what selecting it looks
// like.  `@0` never exists and correctly exits 1 with "can't find window: @0".
// The walk from `@0` to `@3` is in tests\test_issue692_select_window_targets.ps1
// so a real regression there would be caught.
