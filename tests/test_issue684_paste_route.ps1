# Issue #684: where a bracketed paste goes, and the two paste-buffer defects
# found alongside it.
#
# On Windows 10 19045 the inbox conhost (10.0.19041.1) silently removes
# ESC[200~ and ESC[201~ from a pane's ConPTY INPUT pipe and hands the child the
# payload alone.  The pipe write reports success, so psmux could not observe the
# loss and the "fall back when the brackets are stripped" strategy in
# input.rs was unreachable.  The same bytes delivered as KEY_EVENT records with
# WriteConsoleInputW arrive intact on that conhost, which is why psmux 0.4.9
# bracketed there and master did not.
#
# The fix decides the channel up front, from the host's build number and the
# pane child's console input mode, and PSMUX_PASTE_INJECT makes the decision
# testable on a host whose pipe works.  That is what this file does: it proves
# the injection route delivers the markers BYTE FOR BYTE the same as the pipe
# route on a modern build, so a 19045 user gets exactly what a 26200 user gets.
#
# Also covered, both reproduced before they were fixed:
#   * prefix + ] sent `paste-buffer` where tmux binds `paste-buffer -p`
#     (key-bindings.c:422), so that one keypress was unbracketed everywhere.
#   * the in server `paste-buffer` dispatch threw every flag away and pasted
#     the top buffer unbracketed, so a binding, a hook or a `:paste-buffer -p
#     -b name` at the command prompt ignored -p, -b, -d, -s and -t.
#
# The recorder is tests\paste_recorder.cs, compiled here, in two shapes:
#   vt       a byte stream reader (ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT), the node and
#            nvim case, the one the injection route is for.
#   records  an INPUT_RECORD reader, the crossterm / Helix case from issue #98,
#            which must NEVER be handed injected marker bytes because it would
#            show them as the literal characters [200~.

#
# PORTABILITY (gabri-ns ran this on Windows 10 19045 with Windows PowerShell
# 5.1 and reported three ways it misjudged that host):
#
#   * `e is not an escape in Windows PowerShell 5.1, it is the letter e, so
#     every byte exact comparison wanted 65 5b 32 30 30 7e where the child had
#     correctly received 1b 5b 32 30 30 7e.  [char]27 is the portable spelling.
#   * the assertions that pin PSMUX_PASTE_INJECT=0 and then expect markers are
#     asserting the defect this issue is about: below build 22523 that conhost
#     strips them from the pipe BY DESIGN, which is the whole reason the
#     injection route exists.  They are gated on the build now.
#   * the wide payload really is mangled on 19045, on both routes AND without
#     psmux in the chain at all (his measurement: Latin 1 to NUL, each CJK
#     character to one unstable byte, under code page 65001 on the ReadFile
#     side).  That is the platform, so the assertion is strict at 22523 and
#     above and informational below.
