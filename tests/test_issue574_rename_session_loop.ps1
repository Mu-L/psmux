# Issue #574: session renaming fails again in 3.3.7
#
# Reported: this loop dies from the third iteration onward on the 3.3.7 release,
# and works on 3.3.6.
#
#     for i in 1..10:
#         psmux new-session -d          # no -s, so the auto-namer picks "0"
#         psmux rename-session -t 0 "test-$i"
#         psmux list-sessions
#
# On the 3.3.7 release binary (05cc5d4) this produces, from iteration 3:
#     psmux: failed to create session '0'
#     psmux: no server running on session '0'
#
# Same root cause as #505: a server holds the Windows named mutex
# Local\psmux-session-<name> for its whole life (the single-server-per-name guard
# from issue #2), keyed on the name it started under. Renaming migrated the
# registry files but not the mutex, so the freed name stayed locked forever and
# the auto-namer's next pick of "0" hit a "duplicate" server that exited without
# writing a port file. b3d55f8 re-keys the guard on rename, but it landed on
# 2026-07-30, ten days AFTER the v3.3.7 tag (2026-07-20), so no released build
# carries it.
#
# What this suite adds over tests\test_issue505_rename_newsession.ps1, which
# already covers a single rename cycle over the TCP path:
#   * the SUSTAINED loop. One rename/recreate cycle passing does not prove the
#     guard survives ten of them, and the report's signature is that iterations
#     1 and 2 pass while 3 onward fail.
#   * the CLI path (main.rs dispatch) rather than the raw TCP server path.
#   * the reporter's config (destroy-unattached on, renumber-windows on) in play.
#
# tmux parity: rename-session is RB_REMOVE + RB_INSERT, so the old name frees
# immediately and can be recreated. Every iteration must succeed.
