# Issue #641: "Psmux Memory Scaling Issue Compared To Tmux".
#
# Reported as: headless panes created with `new-session -x 500` and
# `history-limit 200000`, then fed the output of a build or an agent, and the
# psmux server climbs into the gigabytes until it dies and takes the pane with
# it. The reporter measured ~1,158 MB for 60,000 lines at that geometry and
# matched it to the model `min(lines, history_limit) * cols * 44`.
#
# The cause was that a row leaving the visible grid was pushed into the
# scrollback verbatim, dense at the pane's full width, so every retained line
# cost `cols * 44` bytes no matter how few characters it held. A 500 column pane
# paid ~22 KB for a 40 character line, about 95% of it trailing blank cells.
#
# Rows are now compacted to their used width on the way into history, which is
# what tmux does: `grid_expand_line` (grid.c:564) only ever grows a line as far
# as the column actually written, `grid_scroll_history` compacts the line as it
# becomes history (grid.c:508), and `grid_get_cell` serves `grid_default_cell`
# for any column past the stored data (grid.c:650).
#
# This script proves it end to end, against the real server, by watching the
# server process's working set while it is flooded.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED
#   1. WIDE geometry (-x 500, history-limit 200000, 60,000 lines): peak server
#      RSS stays under MAX_WIDE_MB. The bound is derived from text actually
#      retained, not from the pane width. Each line here is about 156 characters
#      ("NNNNN " plus 150 x's), so the floor is 60000 * 156 * 44 = 412 MB of
#      genuine cell data. Measured: 1,278 MB before the fix, 420 MB after. The
#      bound is set at 700 MB, which is comfortably above the 420 MB the fix
#      produces (1.67x headroom for allocator behaviour and machine noise) and
#      comfortably below the 1,278 MB the old build reaches, so it cannot pass
#      on an unfixed binary.
#   2. SHORT LINE geometry (-x 500, 34 character lines): this is the reporter's
#      real workload, short build output in a wide pane, and it is where width
#      independence shows up most. Measured: 1,278 MB before, 107 MB after, so
#      the bound is 300 MB.
#   3. NARROW control (-x 80, history-limit 2000): must stay flat, under 60 MB,
#      proving the change did not cost anything on the ordinary geometry.
#   4. The history is still correct and complete after all that flooding:
#      `capture-pane -p -S -N` returns the expected number of lines, the line
#      bodies are intact at full width, and the line numbering is contiguous.
#   5. A compacted history row still renders with its attributes (`-e`), still
#      joins wrapped lines (`-J`), still holds CJK glyphs, and survives a resize
#      in both directions.
#
# Run this against a pre-fix binary and tests 1 and 2 FAIL on the RSS bound
# while 4 and 5 pass, which is the shape of the bug: no wrong output, just an
# unbounded memory cost per retained line.
