# Issue #672: "Warm-pane cd injection uses PowerShell syntax for full-path Git
# Bash default-shell" (TreyThomasCodes, psmux 3.3.8 / 66cf613, WinGet).
#
# Reported: with
#
#     set -g default-shell "C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe"
#
# every pane served from the warm pool carried this in its scrollback:
#
#     $  cd 'C:\Users\trey\trading\newsletter-follower'; try { [System.IO.Directory]::SetCurrentDirectory($PWD.ProviderPath) } catch {}; cls
#     bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('
#
# The first (cold) pane of a session was clean; splits and new windows, which
# come from the warm pool, were not. The reporter's hypothesis was that the
# shell classification matched the raw `default-shell` value against bare names
# instead of its basename.
#
# That is the same defect as #600. 3.3.8's `rehome_command` had no shell
# classification at all: it chose the snippet from `cfg!(windows)`, so on
# Windows every warm pane got the PowerShell form whatever shell was running in
# it. c3a8c64 keyed it on the shell instead; this test is the standing guard
# for the reported recipe, and #672 additionally made the choice a function of
# the SPELLING alone (see tests-rs/test_issue672_shell_basename_classify.rs),
# so a path that is not installed on this machine classifies like one that is.
#
# What is asserted, for the full path (forward AND backslash spellings), for
# the bare `bash` spelling, and for pwsh as the regression guard:
#   1. no `syntax error` anywhere in the pane's scrollback
#   2. no `SetCurrentDirectory` / `try {` / `cls` text (the PowerShell form)
#   3. the pane really is in the requested directory (#{pane_current_path})
#   4. for a POSIX shell, `pwd` inside the pane also reports it
# for a split pane and for a new-window pane, both warm-pool served.
#
# SAFETY: fully isolated. USERPROFILE points at a throwaway temp dir so the
# server's ~/.psmux state cannot collide with a live one, every session lives
# in its own `-L` namespace, and teardown is `kill-server` on that namespace
# only. No process is killed by name and no global kill-server is issued, so
# this is safe to run beside other psmux servers.
#
# Run: pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\test_issue672_gitbash_fullpath_warm_cd.ps1
#      pwsh ... -Psmux <path-to-psmux.exe>
