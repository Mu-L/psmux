# Issue #598 (larroy, 2026-09-22): "not able to paste anymore with iterm2 on mac".
#
# Everything under tests\ that exercises paste over SSH before this file drove
# the connection with the Windows ssh.exe and a REDIRECTED PIPE for stdin
# (tests\test_vt_paste_ssh_real.ps1).  A pipe is not a terminal, so that shape
# can never show what a Mac user sees: iTerm2 is not a Windows console, it holds
# a real pty, and the psmux client on the far side reads whatever Windows sshd's
# ConPTY makes of those bytes.
#
# This file closes that gap.  It drives a REAL Unix ssh client, the one inside
# WSL, under a REAL pty opened with python's pty module, with TERM set and a
# 120x40 winsize, and then writes the exact byte sequence iTerm2 writes on
# Cmd+V into the pty master:
#
#     ESC[200~ <text> ESC[201~
#
# which is what iTerm2 sends once the attached psmux client has turned bracketed
# paste on with ESC[?2004h on the outer terminal.  The pane child is
# tests\paste_recorder.cs, so the assertion is on the exact bytes the pane's
# program received, not on a rendered screen.
#
# Covered shapes, each asserted byte for byte:
#   1. single line paste
#   2. multi line paste with CRLF line endings, which must stay ONE bracketed
#      gesture: if it split, a shell with bracketed paste on would submit each
#      fragment as its own command line, which is what "pasting is broken"
#      looks like from the Mac.
#   3. 17 KB multi line paste, past every internal chunk boundary
#   4. a pane child that reads INPUT_RECORDs instead of bytes, which must get
#      the payload with the markers STRIPPED (issue #98)
#   5. the outer terminal keeps bracketed paste ON for the whole attachment,
#      i.e. ESC[?2004l is never sent before detach.  If it were, iTerm2 would
#      stop wrapping pastes and the user would see unbracketed text.
#   6. THE FRAGMENTED SHAPES, which is where the reported regression lives.
#      The payload is written to the pty in small pieces with a gap between
#      them, the way a paste reaches the Windows side when sshd's ConPTY hands
#      the client its records in separate reads.
#
#      Below about ten bytes per piece, sshd's ConPTY mangles the ESC[200~ open
#      marker itself, measured as ESC[0n ESC[0n ~ reaching the client, so psmux
#      never sees a bracketed paste and falls back to its text-burst heuristic.
#      That part is a ConPTY defect and is out of psmux's reach.  What psmux
#      MUST still do is deliver the clipboard as ONE gesture, because a decoded
#      key in the middle of the run ends it: before the fix a three line paste
#      arrived as THREE separately bracketed pastes with a literal LF between
#      them, and a shell with bracketed paste on ran each one as a command.
#
#      The regression was 5e16dcf (#642), which made a bare 0x0a decode as C-j.
#      That is right for a keypress and wrong for the LF of a pasted CRLF.
#
# Skips cleanly, exit 0, when WSL, a WSL python3, sshd on localhost or key auth
# for the current user is missing.
