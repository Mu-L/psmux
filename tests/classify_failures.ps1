# Classify every failing suite in a run against the archived history of previous
# runs, WITHOUT touching the machine. Pure log reads: it spawns no psmux, kills
# nothing, and is therefore safe to use while a suite is still running.
#
# Why this exists: the expensive way to tell "my regression" from "pre-existing"
# is to rebuild a baseline binary and re-run the suite. But ~/.psmux-test-logs
# keeps a per-suite log for every historical run, so for any suite that has run
# before, the answer is already on disk for free.
#
# Verdicts:
#   PRE-EXISTING   today's exit code matches every historical run -> not new
#   ** CHANGED **  historically passed (exit 0), fails today      -> needs A/B
#   no history     never run before (e.g. suites unlocked by -IncludeInteractive)
#   mixed          inconsistent history -> flaky, needs repeat runs
#
# A ** CHANGED ** verdict is NOT proof of a regression. It only means the
# question cannot be answered from history. Settle it with a real A/B in which
# BOTH sides run under IDENTICAL conditions: comparing a standalone baseline
# against an in-suite HEAD measures the conditions, not the code, and will
# manufacture false regressions.
