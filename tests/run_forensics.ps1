# Runner forensics: who we are, what we kill, and what was true at the instant
# we stopped existing.
#
# ── THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR (issue #680) ────────────────────────────────
# Twice in two days the whole test run vanished mid stride with no crash record
# anywhere. Run 2026-09-20_00-19-17 stopped after 587 of 731 suites, its last
# line being
#     [2026-09-20 06:04:50.125] --- [588/731] Queuing test_newsession_flags ---
# and run 2026-09-21_03-10-11 stopped 20 seconds into a suite with a 240 second
# timeout, its last line being
#     [2026-09-21 03:13:06.856] HEARTBEAT test_issue530_registry_accumulation 20s/240s
# Both times the launcher process was gone too, and no psmux was left running.
# No bugcheck, no Application Error 1000, no 1026, no WER report.
#
# The decisive detail is in spawn_trace.log, not in progress.log. The spawn
# attribution watcher is a SEPARATE process with its OWN console (it is started
# with Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden, and the trace records the conhost.exe
# it spawned for itself). It polls the runner pid and writes a "# stopped ..."
# footer on every voluntary exit, including the one it takes when it notices the
# runner is gone. Neither trace has that footer. So the watcher did not leave,
# it was terminated, in the same second as the runner, although it shares no
# console with it and sits in none of the per suite job objects.
#
# That rules out the two explanations that fit the runner's silence on their
# own: a console control event (it would not reach a process on a different
# console) and a suite's job object (the watcher is not in one). What is left is
# something that killed a whole tree rooted at or above the runner.
#
# Measured 2026-09-21 with a disposable three process stand in for the runner,
# its own console child and its launcher:
#
#   holder in a job with KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE, holder killed
#       -> runner gone, own console child gone, and NOTHING recorded:
#          no console ctrl handler line, no PowerShell.Exiting line,
#          no finally block, no voluntary stop from the child
#   taskkill /F /T on the holder (no job at all)
#       -> identical: same three deaths, same total silence
#   holder NOT in a job, holder killed
#       -> runner and child both survive, heartbeats continue
#   runner killed on its own
#       -> the child notices and writes its voluntary stop line
#
# So the observed signature has exactly two shapes that produce it, a job object
# with kill on close somewhere above the runner, and a tree kill aimed at an
# ancestor, and NEITHER of them can be recorded by the dying process: both are
# TerminateProcess, which runs no handler, no finally and no exit event.
#
# ── WHAT THIS FILE THEREFORE DOES ───────────────────────────────────────────
# Three things, because no one of them is sufficient:
#
#   1. IDENTITY, written once at start into the run directory: the runner's pid
#      and start time, its full ancestry with creation times and command lines,
#      whether it is inside a job object and with which limit flags, its console
#      window and every process attached to that console. If the next occurrence
#      is a job close, the flags recorded here say so before it happens.
#
#   2. A KILL LEDGER. Every kill the runner issues is logged with the target
#      pid, image and creation time, and a TREE kill whose target is the runner
#      or one of its ancestors is REFUSED rather than issued. The ancestry is
#      matched on pid AND creation time, so a recycled pid cannot make an
#      unrelated process look like an ancestor, nor hide one.
#
#   3. A WATCHDOG, in its own process, detached from the runner's console and
#      broken out of the runner's job where the job permits it. It only ever
#      observes. When the runner disappears without writing the end marker it
#      records the moment, which ancestors went with it, what the log said last,
#      and the event log of the preceding two minutes. It exits by itself when
#      the run ends and it never kills anything.
#
# Last gasp handlers (console ctrl, PowerShell.Exiting, AppDomain ProcessExit,
# try/finally) are registered as well. They are cheap and they catch the ordinary
# deaths. They will NOT catch this one, which is precisely why item 3 exists.
