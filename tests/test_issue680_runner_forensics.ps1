# Issue #680: the runner's forensics must survive the thing that ends the runner.
#
# Twice in two days a sweep vanished mid stride with nothing written anywhere.
# The shape of it was settled by one detail: the spawn attribution watcher, a
# separate process with its OWN console, writes a "# stopped" footer on every
# voluntary exit including the one it takes when it sees the runner is gone, and
# neither dead run's trace has that footer. So the watcher was terminated in the
# same second as the runner, although it shares no console with it.
#
# Only two mechanisms reproduce that, and both are TerminateProcess, so nothing
# inside the dying process can record them: a job object with KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE
# at or above the runner, and a tree kill aimed at an ancestor. This suite holds
# the forensics that were added for it to the standard the incident set.
#
# EVERYTHING HERE IS SELF CONTAINED. It starts its own stand in processes, it
# ends only pids it started itself, by pid, and it never kills by image name and
# never touches psmux. It does not run the real runner.
