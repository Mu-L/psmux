# perf_metrics_common.ps1 - the pieces every perf gate needs, in one place.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# --------------------
# Four suites time psmux and every one of them wrote its own JSON with its own
# field names. A run recorded in one file could not be lined up against a run
# recorded in another, and none of the gate files recorded WHICH BUILD produced
# the number: two of the three gates default to the psmux on PATH, the third
# defaults to target\release, and the JSON said only "binary". Comparing a
# suspected regression against last week meant guessing.
#
# So every perf JSON now carries the same envelope:
#
#   schema        the envelope version, so a reader can tell old files apart
#   suite         the suite that wrote it
#   timestamp     round trip "o" format, local time with offset
#   binary        full path of the psmux under test
#   git_sha       short HEAD of the repository the binary was built in, found by
#                 walking up from the binary, or "installed" when the binary
#                 does not sit in a work tree (a cargo install copy does not)
#   machine       computer name
#   os / cpu / cpu_count / ram_gb
#   load          what else the machine was doing: percent of TOTAL cpu busy,
#                 sampled from \Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time, with every
#                 sample a suite took during the run summarised as n/min/p50/max
#
# WHY THE LOAD BLOCK EXISTS
# -------------------------
# The owner's machine routinely runs five or six agents building and testing at
# once, and a creation that is served by a warm spare in 17 ms on a quiet box
# takes 35 ms on a box at 60 percent, while the one creation in ten that has to
# wait out a cold pwsh start goes from 470 ms to 1780 ms. Measured here on
# 2026-09-22 with five other agents building:
#
#   quiet  (2026-09-21 18:41)  new-window  p50 25 ms  p90 110 ms  max  474 ms
#   loaded (2026-09-22 22:19)  new-window  p50 35 ms  p90 794 ms  max 1781 ms
#
# The p50 barely moves because it is the pool's own path. The tail is the
# machine. A JSON that does not say which of the two it was recorded cannot
# tell a regression from a busy afternoon, so the load goes in the envelope and
# a gate may consult it before it decides whether a tail is a failure.
#
# and the same shapes for numbers: Get-PerfStats returns n/min/p50/p90/p99/max/
# mean, and the resource helpers return working set, private bytes and CPU in
# one shape for the server and the client alike.
#
# MEMORY AND CPU
# --------------
# The server is found by its <ns>__<session>.pid anchor file, never by image
# name: a warm standby shares the image and the namespace but never the anchor,
# and the owner's machine routinely has a dozen psmux servers belonging to other
# sessions. The anchor holds "<pid>:<creationtime>" so a recycled PID is
# rejected. Clients are the processes running THIS binary with this namespace on
# their command line that are not the server.
#
# Nothing in this file kills anything. It only reads.
#
# Dot source it:  . "$PSScriptRoot\perf_metrics_common.ps1"

# 3 added the `load` block to the envelope. Everything schema 2 carried is still
# carried under the same names, so a schema 2 file and a schema 3 file line up
# field for field and perf_summary.ps1 reads both.
$script:PerfSchema = 3

# already used, so numbers recorded before and after this helper landed stay
